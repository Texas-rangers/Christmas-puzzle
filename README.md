# Christmas-puzzle
  A little puzzle available for everyone to solve!!! There is no actual reward though,as it wasn't meant to be a public game.;-;
  Caution -> There is a question that you have to answer "Yes" or "No". If you answer "No" there will be a little joke and YOUR
COMPUTER WILL SHUT DOWN.It's a prank but I think it's too horrible so here is awarning to you.
  I am not a creator of this puzzle.Although I am the first person to solve it. :D
